Create a complete Tailwind CSS v4 project setup with a custom design system. Include:

1. The CSS-based configuration needed for: custom colors (primary with 50-900 shades, secondary, accent), custom spacing scale (xs through 3xl), and custom breakpoints (tablet, desktop, wide).
2. Dark mode support using the class strategy.
3. A sample card component HTML that demonstrates usage of the custom tokens (custom colors, spacing, breakpoints, dark mode).

Show all files needed with their complete contents. Use Tailwind CSS v4 conventions (not v3).
