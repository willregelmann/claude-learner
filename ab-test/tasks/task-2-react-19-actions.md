Build a user registration form using React 19's useActionState hook with a server action. Requirements:

1. Fields for name, email, and password with server-side validation (name required, email format, password min 8 chars).
2. Display field-level validation errors returned from the server action.
3. Show a pending/loading state while the action is processing using useActionState's pending state.
4. Show a success message on successful registration.
5. Include both the server action file and the client component file with complete, working code.

Use React 19 APIs correctly. This should work in a Next.js 15 app router context.
